# Project Introduction

This is the Python version of Lybic SDK

Lybic's python SDK is through

1. HTTP request (using the `requests` library) to request the Restful API interface (including the service interface and the restful computer-use-tools interface),

2. or through the `mcp` (Model Context Protocol) library to implement the call to the computer-use tools

For all **http** requests for Restful, please refer to the `@docs/openapi.json` file;

For all **mcp** requests, please refer to the `@docs/tools.json` file.
